# CharacterRecognition
In this project, I am working on character recognition on a digit dataset using MATLAB.The digit dataset consists of 5000 rows of handwritten image of digits in the range of {0, 1, 2, 3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8, 9}. The image of each digit is digitized by 20*20 matrix which adds up to 400 â€“ dimensional vectors. The dataset also has labels set which will help training the algorithm and finding accuracy of it in the end. The programming environment for the project is MATLAB. And, in the process of implementing what is asked, some toolboxes and codes are used for the second and third question which will be mentioned in the following parts. Lastly, some background information is learned to perform some of the tasks like classifying a model with Gaussian distribution.
